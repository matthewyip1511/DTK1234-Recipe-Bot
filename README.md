# DTK1234-Recipe-Bot

Welcome to the recipe bot! This is a bot that I created to prototype my idea for my DTK1234 solution, which would ultimately involve AI-driven solutions
to propose recipes to users to give them ideas on what they would like to eat. It would also make use of predictive algorithms to give better dishes 
that suit the user's tastes and preferences.

The telegram bot is a low-fidelity prototype, as it does not have any AI capabilities and also makes use of a very small pool of recipe ideas as a data source. 
However, this would give users a chance to interact with the bot and give suggestios on the feel and flow of the system.
